# NAT-with-Openflow
A simple implementation of NAT service only for UDP packets, using openflow communication protocol.
The project was created during my studies within Computers Networks 2 subject.
In this project except from NAT, i implemented ICMP Type 3 message,
proactively forwarding of tos traffic and arp reply of 
incoming requests in the routers.
